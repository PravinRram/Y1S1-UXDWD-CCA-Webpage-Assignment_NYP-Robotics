This repo is to host the webpage we made for the assignment for our UX Design &amp; WebDev module for Y1S1.<br>
The assignment was to make a webpage about a CCA, and we decided to make our own called NYP Robotics.<br>
(We worked on this CCA and made our own and new content for the club but I didnt know there was an actual NYP Robotics club before starting)<br>
